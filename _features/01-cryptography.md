Cryptography is the study of how to transmit information secretly. In modern times, it specifically refers to the mathematical study of information and its transmission, which is often regarded as a branch of mathematics and computer science, and is also closely related to information theory.

The rules for making clear and secret transformations are called cryptographic systems. The centerpiece of such systems is called the key, which indicates how to transform -- encrypt or decrypt -- this information. Keys are an important part of cryptography.

In the communication process, the information to be encrypted is called _plaintext_. The encrypted information is called _ciphertext_, and the information only known by the sender and receiver is called the key. Under the control of the key, the process of changing from plaintext to ciphertext is called encryption, and the reverse process is called decryption. In a cryptosystem, in addition to legitimate users, there are illegal interceptors who try to steal secrets (also known as passive attacks) or tamper with messages (also known as active attacks) through various methods.
The disciplines involved in modern cryptography include: information theory, probability theory, number theory, computational complexity theory, modern algebra, discrete mathematics, algebraic geometry and digital logic.
