Polybius Checkerboard is a type of chessboard password, which is encrypted using Polybius Square. That is, the letters are arranged and expressed in the form of coordinates. The letter is the ciphertext, and the plaintext is the coordinates of the letter. Polybius Square is a matrix with 6 rows and 6 columns.

The first row is the number 1~5, and the first column is also the number 1~5. There are 26 letters in the table. Except I and J, each letter occupies a grid, that is, each letter has its numerical representation, similar to coordinates.

The word password becomes 35 11 43 43 52 34 42 14 after being encrypted.
