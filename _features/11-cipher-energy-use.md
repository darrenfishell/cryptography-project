While the Bitcoin mining industry looks to transition to clean energy, most of the electricity consumed by the network still comes from non-renewable, fossil-fuel sources.

As these cryptocurrency networks grow, so does their carbon footprint, further accelerating climate change. As the currencies gain value and new coins are developed in Bitcoin's image, the incentives grow for people to deploy more mining devices, consuming still more energy.

In fact, Bitcoin miners in 2020 [revived a coal plant in Montana](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/18/bitcoin-miners-revive-fossil-fuel-plant-co2-emissions-soared), using enough power to be the facility's _lone_ customer.

According to Digiconomist's [Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption/), Bitcoin's energy consumption equals roughly 204.5 Terawatt-hours per year of electricity, the equivalent to the power consumption of Thailand. Digiconomist estimates the industry's C02 emissions at 114 Metric tons, on par with the Czech Republic.

This energy consumption is tied to Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work method of validating transactions.

The second-largest cryptocurrency platform, Ethereum, [plans to move away](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/) from this model over the next year, instead using a method called proof-of-stake.

In this system, users can validate blocks of data by freezing tokens, as a kind of security deposit. The users that deposit more coins receive a higher chance of validating the next block and, therefore, receiving the associated reward.

Additionally, proof-of-stake is a low-energy consensus algorithm that consumes little to no energy when validating blocks, as it does not require users to spend computing power to solve cryptographic hashes. Any member holding tokens can validate blocks.

A number of other methods are also under development, though few others have been deployed as actual consensus algorithms.

There are a number of ways in which the goal of a more energy-efficient blockchain might be possible. In simple terms, energy efficiency means that people can send and complete more transactions while consuming the same or less energy.

Available energy saving methods are:
1. The existing consensus algorithm can be modified to reduce energy consumption or use energy-saving algorithms such as proof-of-authority and proof-of-stake.
2. Find new ways to make blockchain technology more efficient and easier to accept, such as sharding.
3. More energy-saving technologies can be used for mining operations and updated graphics processing units (GPUs) can be used to make mining more efficient.
