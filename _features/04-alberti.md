Alberti cipher is one of the alternative ciphers in classical ciphers. In view of the shortcoming that the single-table substitution cipher is easy to be cracked by the frequency analysis method, a multi-table substitution cipher is proposed, and a series (more than two) substitution tables are used to encrypt the letters of the plaintext message in turn.
