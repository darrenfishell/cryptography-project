The Alberti cipher is an alternative classical cipher, representing a breakthrough in cipher complexity.

Since the single-table Polybius cipher and direct substitution Caesar cipher can be easily cracked by the frequency analysis method, the Alberti cipher uses a multi-table substitution method.

A successful frequency analysis crack relies on a letter from the plaintext being encoded into only one value in the ciphertext. If this is the case, the codebreaker can use the expected occurrence of a letter to develop a much smaller pool of candidates for each character in the ciphertext.

This type of information is readily accessible with modern computers, but frequency analysis also formed the basis of Morse Code, as inventor Samuel Morse wanted to assign the most frequently used letters the simplest codes.

In this type of analysis, the codebreaker would compare the frequencies in the ciphertext to known letter frequencies in the target language.

The Alberti cipher instead relies on two parallel alphabets written on separate rings of a disk. The outer ring contains upper-case plaintext while the inner ring contains mixed-case ciphertext.

The strength of the cipher method is that it relies on a moving index, meaning that the same plaintext letter will be encoded differently throughout a cipher.

This method either involves placing the new index directly within the ciphertext or by inserting a ciphertext value that aligns with a number in the plaintext disk. The number boundaries then indicate a shift in the cipher index.
